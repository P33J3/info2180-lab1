    <p>
        I am an aspiring Developer who enjoys learning how to create and link frontends
         to databases with an aim of fulfilling the various needs of my applications' users.
        <br>
        I have learnt so far that there is always something new to learn.</p>

    <p> Web Development caught my interest as it allows me to mesh my curiosity for solving problems
        with my love of computers.
        <br>
        It has held my attention because the things I can create can be morphed
        in so many ways.</p>
